# BowlingCalculator
Calculate a bowling score from an input string!

Can be run by feeding in a file of bowling strings, each separated by a newline. Can also be run by opening the executable and typing out the string each time.

As of late 2018, the output now resembles the typical overhead display at a bowling alley!

Please contact me with any concerns.
